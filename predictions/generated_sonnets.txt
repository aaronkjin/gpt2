Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
And so that I did give what I had in my wish
And cry out as a voice of love,
For without anything other I than this love's relent
Whilst at rest might better turn in the eye.
  And yet love would do me harm even if I did not love.

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Him to her line of blood-fed saintly jewels,
Like a condemned island to horrors?
Still thou dost not strive to be absent
Such as is in thee alone;
How I say that, when thou dostst leave thee,
A journey to the root, or embrace life,
Might thou be in me to thee, some place when thou shalt cease.
  When, therefore, each soul followeth,
  And in thy presence thou dost always find
  You, for I am thy wish, not thy devise.

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
And o'erth, making use of his fear,
Lashing out his neck with gusts of wind,
Which lead him forth home, to his nursery.
Then he seeth his beauty upon a scar-beam;
His heart a world of decay;
So full that his sweet sorrow must be endured.
But no contrary love may ever eat
The young fair begets;
But the old heart, who leaves us to his own,
Bending his heart against the one dear,
Shall bear him through his blooming youth,
And fill his childhood with the dead.

O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
Or either decease or draw my gaze?
Wic thou what thought of being short,
With what desire, perchance, of wanting the sea?
Or on my apparel, lack of horse!
But I my appetite here keeps, my time for seeing,
Whilst I never look to it with fear,
For their taste can delight in my intimacy.
  But be, and come not hence, lest she be kept
  Of a quick longing for you, and not in beholding thee.

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot to tell thee of them?
When I do report that I have scolded thee, I die, my fair maidenborn,
Thy statue ruined and torn and rolling, her flute, no longer but touched,
Sheeding that a rebukes should not arise;
Nor that I should complain of myself if not her,
Withal, among many unfavourable witnesses,
The most curious tale that I have brought against thee?
  And yet, writing on their mocking faces,
  Such a rhyme is not yet written, not so readily found
  And at his grave I can see, if

O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
When thou this fool'st a just master,
Or the true judgment more sacred,
Whom am I aloof from each other's view,
And my soul, my virtue and palate jealous?
Whose sullied, angry, brazen hold of Heaven,
Shall give me evil objects and more loved,
And want me to use them to think?
Whose angel at my number would think when I acted,
Or, if my sins were my nature, would it err against me.
  To my spite and rage out, I will kill every one,
  And all these with

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
To give thine friends any good God!
Or are, when I laze man awake,
To tell me; 'What are you, (I did grieve) but a lounger?
As daily pass, so often his days pass.
O, here is ye's present living,
By others' faults, but in God's eye
What has suffered that the drunken sun should tame us.


7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn
Though I free me out of thy bed.
How, then, canst thou seem so esteemed in the first place?
That so doubly a war-wolf should dare lie,
And get their worth by outraging me.
But love's oath has not had time of joy
To erode my influence, so dear, so incouraging.
  And now I have less to avenge,
  One's hands that beset the other's.
  I have more power to use love's power
  To kill rather than have love's power,
  If love's power has

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep,
In love to every gold sight and flower;
The flower's last in a woe's deed.
The splendor and mindfulness of but lovely beauty,
Than all time gave birth, when more is given,
Diluted by all most beloved repute:
All that it gave of and had added was gone.
Dying to this love-setting, within no time
Drank in his true's eyes, and the last well-held house,
Picked a new place in heaven where his older immortal body,
Worshiped more, with greater haste.
  This holy

The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Past the clock, purvey'd with a dear torment.
To him, in his lap, riding his chariot,
No of joy had the rest of his love in use.
No room, meanwhile, in his mind, sirned on left hand,
Had to his heart the stupendous pomp of wearing,
And forced into unnatural sleep by his charms!
Alas, his love had once given me thy first sight,
And so long ago, as if done in vanity or the taking of form!
  But me that beheld my thy steps,
  Even my true love

When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
And say, 'My dear true love, how very fond can this hell
Than this time for this love to make true love?
As she would have been,
Supposed in that mould I should choose
But she would need some other,
Or others, of her gossamer lens.
And the difference I can never find
Is that when she have, women alone cherish,
Therefore woman is all praise, and praise,
The name of love's grown out of her.
  Thus then am I, therefore, and love your value
   Shall not cause your child in all to

Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
Or as the quiet bar doqueaths her breasts to pray;
She I love so well that I can love,
Poward a more gracious lover, to whom she may tear of me.
But although I have love's other love,
I love it even more never to him,
I love nothing but my pretty face but his my beauty.
 
  But since love has taken my heart, then I must give yet another.
  As to his sister, I praise love, but I hate his;
  I even love him my sweetness, but that base glory
  Gives him
