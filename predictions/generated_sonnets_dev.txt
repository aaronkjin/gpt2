Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
Forbid to be my neighbours with thy,
Neither my love nor thy thoughts here could
Cause thy humor, or my curiosity, or his meek wisdom,
To ever me lose those two to him;
And will I make myself king by thy rights,
And interminable persons by thy riches?
  There are enemies, but fools on my old day!
  My mind is confined to thy scoundrels' head,
  But that I may be a court of courage to thee,
  And for that thou art me I may never be alone.


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
Of a cunt's love, from so strong a flood?
There have to be countless flies of sweet love too;
And in what such humble state, in what abate age,
How large are their bosoms?
Of which I best know no stain.
 But though being torn between pleasure and pain,
Whose eyes should be on me, I have lost much;
And already this I let pay for this long wind,
In which such breasts and breasts must shrink,
And when I grow a second young bitch,
To that age he shall look again for shame,
  For fear of


2
So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine may delight.
Thy gift be more proper for that which is so beautiful.
But, thus, then, find I not yours,
Somewhere that is of an almost right grade,
And in what sense sweet praise should I praise you?
 Give me thy love, give it to my heart.
  It shall be mine, I trust.  Now shall be mine place.
  So, be good to me.  Dear, now I have told thee.


3
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
What have thy foibles of infinite enjoyment,
Which thou marst beholdest to the intermission of love
To all should stop my being done.
Lest we repent to to such consummate folly,
In a long place and on two sides,
Thou art to whom these sins can detain me;
And canst thou give him up to those who have abandoned him?
  Or where canst thou comfort me, He
  If that loss is on thy lips, doth justify it,
  Or what such loss is worth is worth how it is done.


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
Thy heart can show thee doom,
Nor can his bright-green speech grow bold.
What thou art, thou art haughtiest of all,
And lookest in his storeworn ear,
Because thou hast some mortal shadow to keep it in your sight.
Yet no doubt it's worth living,
For thou art sure to say my hurt that I shall pay.
  But that in this way leave me their mind,
  And I am glad to have not just waited for thee.


5
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
Yet they never know where thou art.
They see nothing but the shade and the shadow,
Nor perceive where thou dost show
They are blinded, then hear what thou sayest,
But when thou dost hold the empty air,
Grieve not, but go on.
For love, what dost thou have done,
For some or all thou hide,
Look for a masterpiece, when thou speak
And go on, with the love of his presence
To learn the world.


6
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Yet still such forgetful faults can prove
And add some present, chalice to a cold nation.
Farewell to thee, and like thy wondrous beauty
Beauty doth set the Scent of decay by itself
Love's rod sheaves of Nature's jealousity,
As above the sea's blood n'altered,
And yet still she keeps on wetting what doth spirit conjure.
Thy man might be content with my worth or his shade
And use to conceive me sick,
By shame's true nor mine, nor mine merit;
  Which mine love still


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
For here my tongue is force of mine;
He who fetters thee when thou dost not,
Is go against the rights of his soul which is called good,
And needs thee of his shame and praises.
Bitteras thou, impious-minded me,
And with thy tongue, and with thy mind whose no more is true
Conceals myself of my shame,
And holds with thine eyes both riches and my own shame.
  Lo, do no wound
  Thine no cause wish of mine, nor mine eyes that I may.


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
Ought less than what thou wilt have received.
What have of this
Shall thee be my case
When thou art wise, though I call it age?
When didst thou let me control thee,
When I am at a loss of memory
Against time and love then
Nor new jangling growth ever shrill against my heart,
Oh, how thy sufferings seem more real?
'Tis far better to suffer than to die!
  Perhaps from thy shame this patient thy grief
  is also right.


9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
Which I have taken for myself bestow,
Is not my limbs' faith themselves a crime,
Or children myself, and myself am like to thee.
  But many things may be taken for new and more
  I do not love again
  Not desiring to be made again copy.
  See for what I am thus, for what more there is.
  For no wonder that My forr, guilty to my good will,
  Shall grow so deep in thy remembrance.


10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
With my sick question mark is thy sick pride;
That's my science of love.
Yet of mine hand all those lessons scorn,
And now thine do thy might do their own respect.
Lying to each other to make thee feel worse,
But going to thee shows thy sorrow (which is sometimes hate).

Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
The ground of her fray with, but never, in her many pleasant waves,
Sings, in his many banquet's scale,
Time-speaked by his lovely apparition
In her sweetling hands a regular boast,
Beauty's note of kingly carus,
Or a summer's whole summer's fair down below.
  And yet more nearly! She doth smile ever so lovingly,
  For ever, in her sweet heart, holds her beauty in.
