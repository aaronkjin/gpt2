Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
Which in no great change make thee happy,
For never have I doth so well kindle,
Even so fearless of music or flowers by,
To recited hymns, supplications, and enrobed doth your feast.
Here, for thy last care it sost not stave thee,
Whose content is no more aware of you nor of thy love,
Nor my our mutual chide; nor thy shadow are better;
  The choirs of time and their music love you only as your beloved still doth sing;
  So much my faults I in-


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone, but 't is always true.
Can you do me honor the memory of those I loathe,
And give no favour to make my husband feel weak,
That one power in things that would persuade,
Or nurse him by the wounds of illness to honor,
Or desire his favor to his griefs of grief's time?
  Yet I am ever our friend, And I pride not of you,
  I this'ry breast that needs my dear love.


2
So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine may be gone.
So set me, this grave where four witnesses may,
Even henceforth I live, to be the rich teller and expeller.
You, chagrinous bastards, entertain me,
Wretch, what a shame it has been to die with thee
In dead time; but thou what thoughts and mute spirits
The lips of fools take my destiny to scorn.
O, so as to write, do you put me on target
For these hours doth ill illustrate,
The great love which no truth ever stole
And which, since I am deprived, is ever buried


3
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
For the morrow, and in your power as thy love is:
Whilst thou cherish, thou nigh through fortune's first self,
Thy love but war's dear slow day shall,
An end in itself crowned, in the misery of which thou dost hold,
And make amends, and build up the hopes of thyself.
  There come to thee what thou willest from women,
  Not in equal faith with thyself,
  Which do it fear only to tick with much hope,
  And therefore lose those hope, and may profit.


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
Tak me up by thy line thy own relief,
And, notwithstanding you, do welcome me with all thy strength.
And thy deceit must not be treated rudely,
For never tell my name before I give my love to thee,
As thy youthful heart is thy wont, and thou with thy right hand.
  I will do, as you do, if thou ever force me into an evil,
  As I have sold thee dear for his own deeds.


5
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
Which shall disgrace you day and night,
Whilst you gaze upon it from behind.
Do you then see what thine eyes bring in view,
Which public, or public interest, are nigh?
Of you you's post they pass,
And only thy post perceives that which they hold;
To you's eye comes to read, to the plinth.
  To think as I do thus, do I see you by time,
  For nothing in thee gives me to say what thou seest.
  And what is thy life, think most and most in thy sight,

When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
And since she do not understand what she says this more my heart
Than truth it appears she knows to love,
For there must love be many things worthy of love,
Because truth would do when in truth her love is found.
  For no one's heart can know such things to love:
  But a loving nature might be loved,
  And if those beauty stole upon me,
  And made my own love much the fairest,
  Then how can she love me if my love is,
   To express thy gratitude as though love were one and the same?


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Thy sopathy that in cold thou bringest ill
Thou knowest that my thoughts are dim
And may I teach thee more matters of thyself,
For lack of pity's in me incisive
Most of my oft-agreeable short natures thou possess.
  Sufficient now are all my losses, with my inconstancy,
  Then this my painter's sincerest glance:
  Lest a mistake be mine alone, but the smiling strong.


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express a desire.
Or thou, poor fool, didst incommunicate
Against my word my infancy,
And lusted with shame and joy at my hate,
After reason's bitterness, still lingered on me.
A roll I'd to pass from near to afar,
And, though ever he stood in my sight,
What fortune—reconciled from me by each tale—
For such an age as this forsake,
Which heavy hearts are exchanged, I never doth sing.


9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
And 'tis my thought that I should be safe from their love's errors.
Be this thy love thy eyes, and for me that thou placeest me:
Thy love of mine being spendth all their faults,
As to thee, love of mine to mine sight,
Thy revenge for mine sins when they deem me so.
And thus by the womb,
It marries this thought with thee not,
An addition to my love.


10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
Not dead or dead of thee.
How art thou that of heaven's eyes
Thought such to cause me's shame
And now thy love, so self-evident?
Mine love which is dead, stands in everlasting torment;
Thy sickly ill do I like;
But where, his sickness, thy neighbour,
Our love or your love, is found,
My love, by thy death, forsakes thee.
  Let that be thy truth, that thy love never shall find me;
  I will say,  "Is not love that death might feel,
  'tis

Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
My paths and shakes her at every neck,
Her pale face the world's monument to sad words.
And it is true that love will deceive
When love's unknown rider, where thy wisdom lies
Still' hands on his command.
But I would yet have no guilt,
Being comforted that love gave so far,
Not at this age, but soon after,
And when the middle of his heavy back
Says, "Thou'st sure, when I bear thee this example."
  For heaven's price, though thou art a heartless beast,
  For, though thy o
