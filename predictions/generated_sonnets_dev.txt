Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
And strangling me with tears in their eyes,
Now made heaven's self, and yet alone content.
Now gentle-willed, they say in their heart,
That I 'changers with them. They say, 'If it were you that were alone,
Thou shouldst hide a brother's child under thy bed,
For thy own benefit.'
I say they don't. Yet they know that I once loved you,
And like you gave nature thy sustenance.
  And thou, by art thy strength, am most proud,
  To their dost love thy sister,


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
Too many and too many new accidents stifle him alone;
They must think him behind him, who looks from many
And keeps the hope of the future;
For they can do this by all means, but when they see
A change of mind, a wind on their flight,
They will make sure their heart's heart's heart beat,
For it's thought, right in the eyes, is too sad
And that gloomy foet's thoughts appear in that morrow;
But to do away with it all,
To rest it in my time, looking backward,
And I to all the sorrow

So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine's worth may not accumulate.
But now let me pretend,
And tell him that I am no greater than what a git thou havesst,
That which I do that your lovely admirers,
And their hundred and hundred asses will-


They who live so much, take much better care of that likeness,
 That I am such a creature that not you make me better;


When by thee have I often despised, you can make me so;


For not the King's of thy love thy thoughts do again
Have made me happy; but by thee have I loved you so.

Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
Since his self-deprived means, namely thy love,
For being a mistress of mine, and brainless of thy pleasure,
When thou sayest to me, 'Look what I do find,
And how much shall I break with thee where thou spendst?
 'The grooms' who deny you every boon or gain,
Strive to fill your shadow with all their filth,
Nor even to pay thy kindness.
  How sad must I be when thou desirest my respects,
  The poor fool I am, and dost go and tell
  How an art thou shouldst


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
And I, their second best,
As their first best, shall see all thy presence,
To see all thy choirs, on every leaf,
And on all thy sight all thy sound to devise;
And all your poetry is to me too strong,
For I am much mischievous with thee and thy matter,
And thou art in my draw it too much to think.
  But I alone are bound when thou seemest strong,
  For I have never known thee, nor have thou ever proved;
  I am too strong, not to speak but to answer;
  And I

Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies, and,
Upon this side pass they see; but they might not then have
The sight with which they might see them tell.
Might they come hither and be seen with him,
Then, peeping at his bent glance, they may see
His heart in his veins:
But when that pearl shines, how long shall he tell
What men, what what women,
Who love to be seen in him?
  They might then they find in him a man.
  But this thou doest what thou wilt never do.

When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
When in youth married with her made mighty,
More under rose than father, more absolute;
Now she does no more believe in my impiety,
Nor hears my 'our mouth flinched about for scorn,
Nor calls to me by my name at all her faults;
Yet love writes what she says, both deeds and deeds
Despite her thought that her faults of rights
Now dare reckon as much husbandry as they did in love.
  So I shall suffer them to suffer their ill fortunes
  To ravage my love's world with her unmeasured,
  And to smother my


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
You would steal from me my content and spoil from me,
And bide by want of playful-fusion in me,
As if I were to lie, as if I should not.
By these consequences I must leave thee, to thy kind,
And in my place give myself more than thou art willing.
  Thus, by thy interjection, I did leave thee.


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express me thy time;
As it may, I sometimes write my war,
Intend before me with my life to grieve.
More hearty is my most perfidious tongue
Against those my sober sons may ever think me cruel;
They despise, as the birds hate, sweet, happy voices.
  They hate not sweet me with hurtful language,
  That may extoll it best, to give me praise.


9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
And before thou prostrate their anguish.
In thee, my love hangs me till a vision ill,
And to thee find me sad till I rise.
That's my love, not mine, on thee that I love,
For thy darkness and thy haste then answer;
For thou and mine am sorely pleased me,
And hear me rest, my love or hide it on him I see.
  When he who, having weary sins me,
  raths my love, then that hell shall take away my torment;
  For I have doth own in thee, so thou alone'st to


10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
Thy mind but an impure, when thou is done with me
And thy face is made full of shame
And wrinkles on one side which stick but others on another.
Ew, that hath it spied my mind,
From thy offense's poison my eyes love to gaze;
For thus can my eyes love, but if thou hast spied,
O, when thou ill shows thy teeth then scarce cannot I love,
  Which so busy my mind can do by my being reprobated
  And spend two hours a day on my sick heart.

Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch.
The eye, on which she purifies
And the dead break should break, is her to wax with one
Spoiled by night with a night of silence.
She not only what dresses, but she wonders what she prefers.
Till that far-reaching symphony fades,
To mind us by her eyes, too far kept quiet.
Her hour, we can never see; still in her,
A pair of own leaves are constant due.
  This a thing that most might lose by one maid alone,
  All that if they were once so had lost their form.
  Then
