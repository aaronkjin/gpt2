Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
Caught with sorrow on both cheeks as they have drawn.
And shame your dearest young wit
To root a dumb blame and malingering of friends,
When you are so too old, that no fault follows
The frank boasting of old youth.
But still the heart doth recede.
Of such sorrowing my youth,
If he were not died would neither of the difference be mine,
For since him I died so,
Nor save thy sad youth thy appearance.
  My dark days are many, I believe, that my love for him do,
  To me that is most


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
That on every edge of pain let my one confess.
Thus are the veins and blots in my heart,
Though others take my mark, or it is left undone in my death,
With my life to say so, and it would and long have been well
To fill my sense with their gold with slanted shaft;
But who from on high holds to riches near.
 And the more is my heart to rejoice,
The better my love will be.
  I may live though I die, but are true to him.


2
So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine should be
The sum it's worth for my true pleasure,
And thus it may, my true bankruptcy;
May a certain dilution
Shall overtake one of what I left, and in this one I lose
To thee; whereupon, thou willst long be free
And have little money, if it shall not break,
And leave me a marketr, where my own legs
Seeking for greater increase, reaped with blossoms,
For I may see thy merit due.
  I may lie, and he, and thou, and all that I have.


3
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
From strong desire and bad talk,
Or with your whimmed hand bestow this wretched
Beauty of my brow, have thee treasure.
But mak me pay the raiment of my sincerest;
Or I will do nothing before that time,
To mind your hour's demand, but all will be right.
  And they will wonder when you bestow this will,
  As if nothing since you have been greater.
  And take no heed, since thou art all of a most choicest kind.


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
O Thou best lover, so happy are thy desires;
For thou spareest them that belong
To thy reason, so sweetly wistful do I am.
O my love, thou breakest my love's heart,
And account my love's heart still that she provest me,
After lover's love, the same as if thou prad'd me,
And form fair thou it's alms for me,
Here dost thee clap thy hand when thou meet.


5
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
And why do they consider not what they see?
They are utterly empty of all knowledge
And never leave either eyes or vision's eyes.
The friend of a peppy fool who with how much languor glides
How he alone marvels.
Why therefore, pray thou that I will of thy sight
Part with thy eye and enjoy all myself on thy brow,
Though any works, or thoughts, or troubles be suffered,
Still I adore thee in my mind,
For I love my Lord so I think his happiness is to me.
  No live, don't mind my sufferings,



6
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
And then leave me at my testament-shell and thy pen
And take such beloved people's knowle as you,
For everything I do I walk in, by virtue of which,
The oft-rising mother praise
To thee in holy fountain, lording all my pleasure
And treading things so dear.
Such is my beauty that thou didst first conceal
These and thou didst not make yourself known,
For I doth blame myself more myself than thou didst of me.
  I with my love in love and use in delight,
  Then if my love is truly true,



7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
To acknowledge thee, if thou shouldst stay still,
By thy o'erthritude, that in my weary, sallow ear,
Which all women most hast, being like her,
Have today in all their present affairs perverted,
Thy oil and dress."
Some alliance is such duty, my own thoughts,
Nor would a man, should the place need any clearer
At this or, in any other, gentle nature
Dispose of my cause,
And cut me no longer in length, but on this animal point
Under the cry of battle, "O, dear friend


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
The pleasure of harming my wounds which I place
In vain recompense.
But I bear no such heed, what kind of prisoner do I best?
Supposing there be, speak the truth,
For thou hast indeed perverted my mind's will,
Which words have proved my true self more;
That though I am such as to love heaven,
I leave my religion sweetly assailed by need.
  Yet to me so malignant not have they
  But things which have occasioned my loathing,
  And yet they have made me a gift from thee.


9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
As you most self-indulgent and even if not lying.
Dinner is not my discourse, but the only body,
For I have found the very steele of this book;
But as that body not doth stand in your view;
Won't I use your name (for my tongue, that be write,
Is not your friend enough of me);
But to other my quick thought, why, if I be friends,
Or what that person's deeds say,
In letters and thoughts on words and print;
For my limbs are naked or dead,
And I love at


10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
For that I shall do enough to hate thee.
With mine state thou dost say thee, "Does not this love live by giving,"
But that I do such acts for myself:
  For I am, in my beauty, thy body's material,
  And that it live by my painless death.
  Therefore love is my love; that is, love alone is my trust,
  To love everyone less or more.
  Then love will live by my promise; if only I will.
  But do thou not say that love love must live on my part?
  O,

Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
To raise up that bright, golden king;
And she sends forth her red child, and its nostrils
Distainted by the sun's colours:
The Oven that bears fruit graces to slay,
And set once more for bounty one queen's hat
With her golden beauty from afar.
  From then on all sweetly, dreaming of her own night,
  Said that she used her precious wrath
  To make her ward the eyes of fools,
  That they should know how to turn away.
  As for her absence, each heart thinks,
  That most excellent and most pleasing
