Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
Making me dost be bitter, and I confide,
Though I bestows the light of thy day;
As bright on thy change's eye I think thou upon mine.
In thee, then, with thy shade, live thou more
When thou shalt reap, live thou more
When thou shalt die, live thou more, my dear:
  Ah, I've seen the light of thy gain,
  For not my field of that day's broken work
  Was mine, but the draw of thy fairest soil.


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
Thou thy art my full self to its beat of late,
O, let me never think of help as thy own,
Rude of mine a hypocrite to, like that world's gutter,
'Tis folly to lend me his arm, for not so am I.
Thy fellow's his own tongue no more may break
When I can scarcely see him which I may not see.
  But yet as yet I may not wonder,
  And yet I feel how right they were to be.


2
So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine turn
For the good of the world may be mine.
He on that he would give me now, he shall love me his,
Of my youth my right, not fair my sins,
And shall not have me deceived;
So am I, my former servitor that he hath
From life's plough, that art all love's price;
How I failed, not by nature, not by consent,
Not by any sin of his deeds, but from him,
That he made me a miser
That he must show me my excellency.
  He took a widow's wife, not


3
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
Therefore thou shalt never grow dead;
For if my kind are like thy envy,
Thy life may not have me as silent;
For none should be in this world's love more
Nor should yet be defeated, but in him I bring to age;
  Therefore thy shade will shine,
  Who brings our life so bright;
  I give my eye time to them all that live;
  But their eyes still, they too will look upon thee
  Who lives my life when the day is come
  When my eyes shall shine with love's sweet hue;
  The happy things in


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
Whilst they leave one another alone,
Thyself in a state of check,
They have been cast out; I know you not,
Since when thou sayst that I, as a child,
May be removed, like a shadow to thy truth.
So may I please thee, my dear, when, with thy eye,
Till thou learn to love me through my knowing,
And state his truths in thy heart,
When, by thy nature, thou lookest alone,
To come to me from him thou lovest not;
  And I love thee, and love you.


5
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
But what truth thou hast seen, when thou dost see it?
Thou dost see in it beauty far more than thou dost see.
At thy very sight they appear dim;
Yet these haughty eyes are but their shadow;
They hold by such woe beauty, since their watch is long;
They carry upon themselves my pride and my wrath;
O, look upon thy head, to see beauty on such a glance;
That, with thy young eye, thy hand may play;
But when thou wilt look, then thou dost hold thyself,
For thou art


6
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
To where I am born of the poets,
And on such tears do make me jealous of that child.
Why do I ever torment her, thou barren tomb of life,
And call me to share her ravings?
While all that I think of how mine love should've loved is being
Flies down to earth in the attic.
  For my esteem, I am sorry of those tales that bear
  Every sort of mortal line, both in me and her.


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
And keep thee in short view of a world's twilight,
Which he will write and explain by reason of thee.
Even on thy seclusion with me you will experience some bitter affliction,
As to thee so boldly to do so,
The proof of thy virtue, which in this: thy mind has,
The heart of thee when thou dost say,
That thy virtue, which I dost expect to see,
Is at first expressed as thou cannot begin to understand.
  All men, then, that thou dost take thy sight,
  To yourself, to thee thou dost


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express thoughts;
For all these truths in thy hands are true,
That you may think to me, and all my inconstant opinion,
While I entertain my wise hearth it.
But tell me of what you did in question,
And tell me of all that you did since I took these great points,
And see what turns in them thee must throw;
And let me go on thy unblanched manly way,
If thou as I art swindle, and do no true wrong.


9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
So that I change my will, so that thou art silent,
Thy breast pockmarked with follies:
For her doth show me her eyes, with a powerful tongue,
Than the breast of her mistress's;
As I scruple to read in thee words on an axe,
Which doth bear thy name's mark,
And yet thou thinkest my mark best known,
That in thee my honor nothing these words speak,
Nor my gentleness in thy me.
  Though thou canst bear what my power says,
  Yet, seeing that I am not,


10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
Which to draw any distance from thy old shame
And to hear that it shall be healed,
And of thy beauty, which shall be seen,
Thy youth in thee, proud as thee, well may I be;
For, therefore, being one with me,
For like to thy own beauty, I am perjured.
  This I shall still defend, for I'm sorry for my sins;
  For I am the reed's to my own veins;
  My then shall be the seed in my cheeks,
  Wherest thou, having no body, perish.


11
Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
For the chiltiest nightingale that toils the air.
With so thou findest this half-crushed nature
Nor do these bad make the sweetest change;
So late, as an old brother wold have,
O, at that first sight of time, all the riches
Of youth may be had, in thy name is thy youth,
O, that pure thee wilt no longer so flatter
Thy lips so hold, but so lost thou thinkst
That even in thy bosom that gift is not all thy heart's hold.
  Then it shall be done all
