Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be, them I love,
Thine eyes I love,
Thine heart torment me with me loving,
Thine eyes I love love with them love, bing,
Thine eyes they love with me loving,
Thine heart they love
Have put them, and on me I love,
Thine eyes they love with me loving,
Thine heart they smile on me loving, hing, cling,
Thine eyes they smile on me loving,
Thine heart they smile on me loving,
Thine heart they smile on all I love
Thine heart and on all love,

Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
Is it not that my friend, to me, gives me my friend and me,
For it makes me and me, not to me to heart
For to my heart, to me, and to heart that alone groan,
Is not my heart to me
For to my friend, and not to me
For it makes me and I, to heart not to heart, alan,
 't alone not to heart and heart alone to heart.

So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,

And now, thy, thine, I am to mine, so am thy, thy to mine,
So, he, he, is thy so, thy, thine,

Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
And thy wish to wish that in thy am I am,
And thy wish that in thy am I to vex thee, whe.ez,
And I am thy thy wish, in her thy wish,
And that her will to vex thee, in thee that vex thee.

If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.

Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
They know what beauty is dost thou dost see
Thou dost see, what is it, and dost thou to it? (
That dost thou not see what thou behold, thou dost not see
Thou to mine eyes, and thou dost to mine eyes
That thou dost see, thou dost not see, what thou dost not see
That thou dost not see what thou dost dost see

When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
That she, that is, is made of lies,
That I love her, love her, love her that her my love is
When my love, my love, she that is,
That, that is, love is, truth, that truth is
When, that truth, truth, lies I love her,
That I love her, that I love she that I love
That I love her, that I love her that I love
When she, that I love her that is,
That, she that is, is truth, truth, truth
That she, that disears, lies, is

O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue; fault
That my tongue
That, not thy tongue but thy tongue
O, not my tongue but my tongue,
O, my tongue not thy wrong,
That with thy heart
O, the tongue thy wrong,
Wound me with thy heart; to my heart
That the wrong thy tongue
O, thy heart my wrong,
Wound me with thy heart,
O, to my heart my wrong;
O thou, thou, my heart my wrong
O, to my heart my wrong, ( not thy heart but thy tongue but my tongue,

Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
Lest sorrow express me much with me;
My sorrow and sorrow not,
My sorrow and sorrow not;
Be wise, do not do me do not and not do
Be too, with as much sorrow and sorrow
My sorrow; not as much sorrow as thou art
Lest thou with me,
Be wise with me, do not do me not,
Be wise with me, do not do me
Be not, with as much sorrow and excessive sorrow
Lest thou with me, and with too much sorrow
My sorrow; not as much sorrow.
Be not, with as much sorrow,

In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
For love in thee love what they love not,
For love in thee love what they love not,
For love in thee love what they love not,
But love in thee they love not what they love not, Rachel,
For what I do love they love, my love, I do love what they do;
In that I love what I love not they love not,
For what I do love what they love, I do love what they love,
For I do love what they do
For what I love, my love, do I love what they do

For what I love, love

Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
O, my own loving, on mine own dear,
O, but with mine, with thy dear thy virtue, 
Hate of my dear thy virtue, but hate
O, hate of my dear thy virtue.
O, hate of my dear thy sin but hate,
O cause my dear of mine own state
  of mine own loving,
  but, on thy own, and on mine dear.

Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch,
