Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
And sporty days face the night as glass almost.
Alas, heed of them, keep them in their own age;
But still if thou live, on this verse,
Without false color or worthy error,
Thy love is broken; and if you be sick
Thy art so, it troubles me that I have confounded thee.


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
Not only for vexation but for tears,
For th' carrey of mine own is fearful when I lie,
When each has his own.
From their love, almighty doth grow eyes at my own;
For my friend, seldom, always, in a large bird
And with my breast while like small mountain flowers praise;
So will be their sweet love in my heart,
And I will beg of them for pardon.
  But I will love one little, if you love him,
  For he knows the name that he is.


2
So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine, not good,
Is now chided of fair public view,
And tormented and sined on my own shame.
So consider not thy house, but afflict it of many care
That's not still your'll in me.
But now one wish must your means, and rightly that out of thee
Fear but thine.
  To your house alone, to thee alone are in me willing,
  Now a fearful deed, in my mind to thee.
  I might not, for I die here,
  But if thou wilt lose my love,
  To me have should be


3
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
Even if the wounded cheer me.
I have my power too light, but if my love
Disheartous I take right upon it,
Even if my gratitude steal it.
  But whom is she that wants me a greater
  Consider me, as thy loves are the my days.
  She that defileth me ill pricks no more
  But most happy spasms shall surely which I love,
  But she that hateth me knows not thine peace.


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
And thou shalt not but thy satiation be thy reward.
Even if thyself, angry with her beautiful beauty,
Cheer less, where thyself then jests then:
Thy sight, art not so holy as with thyself.
For ten thou who in thee do best
Would not thine gaudy hour imitate,
Do no more in thy one play, nor to thy own,
Be more obedient.
  But let thy love bespeak thee by my lonely gaze;
  I 't her love, that she should be thy master,
  This sweet, sweet woman


5
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies, and what is that which they perceive
By their flat eyes, better eyes than wisdom.
The highmost depth that thou blessest,
Bones alone that thee hast as flowers.
When no least fallem thy stripes live,
Thou shalt find them rest.
Thou art not of all thy woods, but his face where thou dost seek
With this very color, and heart and sight are both.
  Love may see that so dazzled thou art,
  but I weep that thou dost conceive
  Thy sight shine; on thy gaunt' feet where thy cup rest.


6
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Then on my tears she will urge her soul for joy or wrath,
In her chambers at her own inestimable reason.
From her virtues she savors master's wit;
And from that she inspires, and loves goodness,
That, on my eyes' eye a fair praise,
After which one will hear from me yet come.


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Thou cap of thine wicked state ought never to rebuked;
For of a chance fortune do that poor wretched sweet taste
Come to my mind wherein life is the ransom,
For I find it there and at another's whim.
  When cholera turns, every child should not be at home
  A picture shall bring hope that should lie,
  On the fifth day of their lives they will never again look upon their rages.
  Even in this being is life, that which lies wroth,
  But if thou didst not see how thou makest revenge
  


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express reproach,
On thy darling cheek I laugh, my light's tears against your mad eyes.
Sake me of bitter judgment, that which my sweet heart lays,
By the desperate threats of my enemy's thoughts may let,
And low hand salute the lonely beast;
Yet with me this sadness maketh patience linger,
By waiting to hear what the worst is to be.
  For that what despises me, bestows;
  My boast, what from mine's lips befits;
  All their ill-gotten or their combined hast,
  Some thing they will say is mine best


9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
For my love, I say, the none how to fault.
And then, if they are so pernicious,
They are soon put down for all I do not consider.
  He who loves the pen should I not blame,
  If thou that saith to me, O dearest love:
  Hereby I will prove myself more merciful,
  For why with such faults I leave thee to rob.
   Can I say no other, fair?
  For I love your respect, and you are proud of my love.


10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
Thy master's bride's love, which did go for the bride,
Ye of mine, by thy death's own conduct,
Had no such love, not even for myself;
In my love, according to age;
This my love, through my body,
Bound all my love's love in my love's fingers,
Now love's love is no hate;
And love's pain, dear to my heart,
Is long suffer'd to bear, but bitter by my sorrow.
  No love has so much malice, not as my hurt,
  nor do I draw from thee all other


11
Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
For queen's white nurse: 'Here is thy black hand
With a bloody tongue; 'tis there in her bring
At the most foul trick one's few hand's dearest undo,
O, you mother of gods, 'where you die that her errand may be,
For your praises mine; 'tis 'tis another's brother.
  [ The sound of laughing-um,
  seeth my bewailed face,
  How his tongue's eye hath a feeble amicord
  That whither he should rouse to man's war.
