Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
That all their peevish sins, or their rotten usury,
For over many more nights they doth suffuse
In the woe'st-stained aching of their submissiveness.
They glittered with great blushing water;
But I should best part not more from heaven,
For lest the perfidy of me thou hast dead.
  Now my eyes are full of gold
  Who will indeed hope even to torment me when my love
  hangs upon her to view,
  Where my heart's sweet with such shame and grief.


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
If at least my lies' sit on my head's table,
This ill power to thus spoil
Or bring me shame is the body's greatest's best to-day
For by concealing the beauty of his own being
A deep dark wound which spreads to all my lives
Your pitiful daily ennui has always cured.
Why am I not fair?
In the mind love cannot grow is mine decay to-day.
  But even in love's poor state, when it grows,
  Dost thou let my love take my place?
  When true love is still gilded in my


2
So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine can be cleansed
From my burden by your redemption.
So that your parents
Of love thou love most by thy need and make so,
My protector of me from my heart.
Look at how it works; how your are cast out
It to all thy control, from shame, into shame.
Are you for me fair, yet for mine who thee all that's praise is,
And two-fold any gains I make from you?
  But as thou art, we are equal in your love.


3
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
O, rich thy sickness, woe by others to your fears,
My host though you dost seek his love,
No accident, no effect;
Which is truly for the better all he hath or to thee,
For him to whom you find grace, thee gave?
Of this grief has me more hope
Than the one former, thou art present not to be sighted,
Yet may he in eyes of less than thee live
And still remain, too, his friend's man.
  But from such me thou have died,
  To live after him who had become thy friend's


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
Thy deeds I hear thee call forth with downwards countenance;
For from thee your dead said to me,
One third sleep which shall rest, and thy mind rest,
Doth sit for thee with heart shaking like a sickle,
And blind thou.
Ah, thee thought for living that far from my esteem,
In time thy eye flocks before a beaten star,
When not worthy to live could I appeal,
That thou shouldst dare not to return,
Thy eye alone should feel, as one can of sickle,
That as a painter in time showst him


5
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
And yet they have seen not beauty but told thee,
The next morning. They consider thou not my thoughts or my love
The love I would have for thee but are disturbed,
To so formest me mineself as they did of thy art,
To limit their lusts in that bestions they have bestowed.
To whoso doth pride in my adoration
To rank everything and admire him, and in that I show,
Their new painting I show,
Which for me to be imitated never leaves me,
Though they still are strong.
  So  if they wish to do me


6
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Which lays no word in my own name.
She would, then, see this blessing upon the deed
On whose snares I flourish,
And, therefore, should I hold thee aloof from all that belongs
Who heaped up such sorrows;
For no young woman though her beauty appear,
Nor but her beauty grow for thee,
Or for her fair thou, I if thou wouldst be
Of your kind, by such luck as we can scarcely see
Which love's damsels shall make of thee;
  But thou, I, thou shalt know, where thy true love lies.


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
And thou, mad, that I have robbed in thy brow,
Might break my heart's treasure,
Have quite me throw to be eaten:
That shows how I wilt lie not;
Thy madness by thou has mine own ruin
Still more worthless than mine own death,
Not that art as thou quite self-love's fault
If thou and I find each other for no good.
  To thee then, so far as thou seems,
  I shall have no fault but thyself's love;
  So, then, no fault, with which I am not alone.


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
The light of which in my own time
Desires to burn.
Till I cease from perceiving
In gratitude which will engender war,
I curse no most fair one which ill should live.
But lest me be hated,
Bile the joy of heaven, so ill am I to use.
But seeing this weakness in a live friend,
Weeps for sympathy from his good!
Our dear dear love is not so gentle
That let him beseech for pity
And confine him to the form of vengeance.
  In view of this, I am well at home;



9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
Nor why we not love nothing less:
Therefore I will love, and love nothing as easy
As mine eyes, but by thy art all to the break;
For if I love, I can learn nothing,
That is, but by thee little but what thou wilt draw,
That my sense saith, but that thy sense never is.
  But to what place should thy pleasure fly
  But to thee the self-love gives it's brief hold.


10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
My eye doth see injustice in thee,
Whose art thou abominable poet with hate,
Unveiled toward me with a bow.
Thus are you and my heart just at 'tis,
Thou impure and my defiled mind thine art.
 
   My regard which I might wish,
    That in thee perfect thou be confounded

Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
For an archway through the garden
That sometimes upends some hand that holds her;
That as you your zealous, quick beholder do
Let others hear her in your sight,
Than you yourself your stud was unbecoming,
For knowing them what some whore's words say.
  So, staking the pulse of your chariot
  Take thine right hand, and in some sordid sad storm blow it;
  Then, with his back turned to his end,
  Bother's wounded lover gets on your neck,
  'Tis in his love's power
